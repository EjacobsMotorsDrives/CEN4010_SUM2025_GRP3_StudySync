### 🏷️ 1. Project Title
**StudySync: A Platform for Finding and Joining Study Groups**

---

### 📝 2. Proposal Summary
Students often struggle to find peers who are interested in forming study groups for shared classes, exam preparation, or project collaboration. Existing solutions like group chats or campus forums tend to be disorganized and inaccessible—especially for fully online students.

**StudySync** addresses this by offering a centralized, searchable platform for discovering and forming study groups based on courses, topics, and availability. The platform enhances collaboration and builds community in both traditional and remote learning environments.
