# ðŸ“˜ StudySync â€“ Design Document (Deliverable 2)

**Course:** CEN4010 â€“ Software Engineering  
**Semester:** Summer 2025  
**Team:** Group 3 â€“ StudySync  

---

## 1. Introduction

This document details the software design for **StudySync**, a web-based platform that enables university students to create, find, and join study groups. The design focuses on a clear separation of concerns, modular development, and user-centric features to streamline group collaboration.

---

## 2. High-Level Architecture

**Architecture Style:**  
Model-View-Controller (MVC)

**Overview:**

- **Model:** Manages application data, including users, study groups, and events.
- **View:** Renders dynamic HTML/CSS for user interaction.
- **Controller:** Handles incoming requests, updates the model, and selects the appropriate view.

```

*Insert a simple diagram showing how Model, View, and Controller interact.*

## 4. Data Structures

- **User Records:** Stored in relational tables (MySQL).
- **Group Membership:** Many-to-many mapping between users and groups.
- **Messages:** Stored with timestamps and sender references.

---

## 5. Algorithms

- **Search Algorithm:**  
  Keyword-based search for groups and events.

- **Recommendation Algorithm:**  
  Simple matching based on shared courses/interests.

## 6. Interface Design

**Wireframes / Mockups:**

- Landing Page
- Group Directory
- Group Details View
- Chat Interface

```

\[Insert screenshots or links to Figma/Mockup]

## 7. Security Considerations

- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  User sessions managed securely via JWT tokens.

- **Input Validation:**  
  All form inputs sanitized server-side.

- **Data Protection:**  
  Passwords hashed using bcrypt.

- **Access Control:**  
  Role-based permissions for admin actions.
