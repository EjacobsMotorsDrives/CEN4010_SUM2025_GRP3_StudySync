## 📝 Project Description

**StudySync** is a web application that simplifies the process of finding and joining academic study groups. Designed for both in-person and online students, it provides a structured platform to:

- Register using a .edu email for identity validation
- Create or discover study groups based on courses and interests
- Schedule meetings and post messages
- Integrate with tools like Zoom and Slack for real-time collaboration

Initially built with a **frontend-only simulation using CSV files** in VSCode EDU, the project will later transition to a full-stack deployment on **Ubuntu** or **GoDaddy** with **Node.js/PHP and MySQL** backend support.
