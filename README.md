## 📝 Project Overview

**StudySync** is a web-based platform designed to help college students **find, join, and manage academic study groups**. It offers:

- **.edu Email Registration** for verified student access  
- **Group Browsing & Creation** by course or interest  
- **Scheduling & Calendar Integration** for study sessions  
- **Group Message Boards** for quick communication  
- Planned integration with **MySQL backend and REST APIs** for production deployment.

Originally developed as a **frontend-only app** using CSV/localStorage in VSCode EDU, it is transitioning to a **full-stack system** hosted on **Ubuntu/GoDaddy** with Node.js/PHP and MySQL.
